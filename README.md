# Political-Terror-Scale
Using data from the Political Terror Scale project (http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/), I've tried to build a dashboard that shows the evolution of human rights scores for countries around the world. The current version of the dashboard is available here: https://akrishnamurthy97.shinyapps.io/political_terror_scale_ak/.
