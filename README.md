# Political-Terror-Scale
Using data from the Political Terror Scale project (http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/), I've tried to build a dashboard that shows the evolution of human rights scores for countries around the world. Credit for data collection and organization goes to the folks involved with PTS. The current version of the dashboard is available here: https://akrishnamurthy97.shinyapps.io/political_terror_scale_ak/.
